    <h1>Digital Audio Workstations</h1>
    <h2>And how they function</h2> <h5>by John Nuttall</h5>

    <h2>iMacs</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>iMacs can cost from around £800 all the way up to £2000+. iMacs run MacOS which was made by Apple, which is supported by many great DAWs (digital audio workstations) such as Garageband and Logic Pro, which are both also made by Apple. A DAW has many features in it to make music production much easier. These features can include the loop library, automation, etc. At this school, the primary DAW used is Garageband, which is made by apple and is fairly easy to understand because of its low number of features compared to other DAWs. Despite the less features, it can still do a lot of stuff and most the stuff the average person would need to make music. Depending on the mac you buy, the proccessing power and RAM are usually higher with more money paid for them, usually macs come with around 4-8gb of RAM and around 3Ghz of processing speed.</p>

    <h2>MIDI Keyboard</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>MIDI Keyboards can cost from around £100 to £1000 or more. A MIDI Keyboard inputs MIDI data into a DAW by pressing the buttons which trigger input. MIDI is sound that can only be read by DAWs, and when the data is read by the DAW it will/should sound like the selected instrument. If you use the MIDI Keyboard to record different instruments separately you could make a song with it.​</p>

    <h2>Headphones​</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>Headphones can cost from £10 to £3000. When listening to audio you have recorded you may want to make sure only you can hear it to prevent disturbing other people or any other reason, or maybe when recording you want to see the output of the music being played in better quality. Headphones audio is usually outputs better audio than the base speakers of the device it is connected to. Headphones are usually connected to a computer via a headphone jack in the back of the computer.</p>

    <h2>Audio Interfaces​</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>Audio Interfaces can cost many different prices. Audio Interfaces can be connected to instruments and microphones which will connect them to the computer. When recording the audio interface will convert any input it gets into data which the computer can understand so it can be read back.</p>

    <h2>Speaker Monitors​</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>Speaker Monitors can cost £300+. Speaker Monitors or Monitor Speakers are speakers which can play inputted audio at a very loud volume if needed. They are made specifically for music production. They are used for monitoring during recording, mixing, etc.</p>

    <h1>Quick Garageband Walkthrough</h1>

    <h2>Tracks</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>The 3 main track types in Garageband are: Audio, Software Instrument and the drummer track. The audio track is simply, normal audio. The software instrument track uses MIDI so you can use a midi keyboard with it or use the typing keyboard built into garageband. The drummer track automatically makes a drum track based on what you need.</p>

    <h2>Editing Tools</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>The main editing tools are: copy (copies selected data), paste (pastes data on clipboard), cut (deletes data and copies it), loop (loops the track over and over again).</p>

    <h2>Quantise</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>With quanitse, in the midi editor, quantise lets you put all the notes at the first beat based on which first beat you want.</p>

    <h2>Automation</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>With automation, you can make track properties change based on the time in the song which allows you to make effects such as fading in or fading out.</p>

    <h2>EQ</h2>
    <div id="par1">
        <p>With EQ, you can change the overall sound of a track and it lets you optimise them. If you were to use EQ on the master track you could affect the whole project.</p>
